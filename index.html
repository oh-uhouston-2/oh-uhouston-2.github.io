                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>...a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository...</h2>

		<p>... is leading us into war.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)">The Clone Wars</a>, that is.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>... you just said three things that all mean the same thing.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                great way to apply your skills to work on projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface, making video tutorials to
                help new users, and myriad of other ways. Open source
                software is often produced by lots of people
                collaborating, and is welcoming to everyone,
                including newcomers.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                programming skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
